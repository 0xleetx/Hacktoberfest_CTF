# Pr0d33p - Twine

## Challenge Flag: hacktoberfest_ctf{str1ngs_2_w1n}

## Write-up:

First of all I downloaded the binary using wget https://github.com/Hacktoberfest-Nepal/Hacktoberfest_CTF/raw/master/Reversing/beginners/Twine/Twine, marked it as executable, chmod +x ./Twine entered random password and got false positive flag.

Later, I ran strings ./Twine and got a string of y0u_g0t_17. So, I used this as password and got the flag
