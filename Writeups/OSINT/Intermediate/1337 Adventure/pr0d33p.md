# Pr0d33p - 1337 Adventure

## Challenge Flag: hacktoberfest_ctf{Gondar, AM, ET}

## Write-up:

Didn't have idea on how to start, was thinking it has something to do with geo co-ordinates. 

So, I visited https://opencagedata.com/demo. Entered 13, 37 in Coordinates and decoded it.

Seen ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹ North Gonder, Ethiopia. I searched for "North Gonder, Ethiopia" in google. Opened wikipedia, I figured out that spelling of "Gonder" is actually "Gondar".

Noticed this was located in Amhara Region, Ethopia.

I expected full city name, the region and the country might have been represented in the form of their respective codes.

Finally taken in flag format with hacktoberfest_ctf{Gondar, AM, ET} and also put spaces between another word and comma. submitted the flag and boom,
I was the first and only one to solve this challenge.
