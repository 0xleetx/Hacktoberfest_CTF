# Pr0d33p- Tweet tweet üê¶

## Challenge Flag: hacktoberfest_ctf{rickrolled_for_the_flag}

## Write-up:

Got a twitter account from challenge description, visited the link. Noticed a website and removed tweet replies.

At  first, went to rabbit hole searching for deleted tweets. Later realised the website also must be for a cause.

For website too, visited https://archive.org/ and pasted the website. It showed no flag here. Anyway, went to view source and seen <filenmae>.mp4,  since i was hunting for flag  :D   i thought it might be the filename, also did same in way back machine, downloaded the file and started watching it.
*Volume muted tho* :D In the frame arounf 1:22 of video noticed something went 5 second back and reduced speed of video and got the flag.
