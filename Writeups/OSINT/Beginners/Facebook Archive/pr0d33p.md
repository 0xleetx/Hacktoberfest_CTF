## Challenge Flag: hacktoberfest_ctf{h0w_4b0u7_sh4r3d_p0s7_3d17_h1st0ry}

## Write-up:

During the event, only Binit Ghimire had a session on CTF related thing. So I went to his profile, checked his shared posts of Sagarmatha Hacktoberfest event, found a post shared at 12:37am in midnight 12 hours before his session at 12:45pm. I checked its edit history and then found the flag in the post's second revision.
