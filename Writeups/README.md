# Write-up Format

Just create a directory with the challenge category, create sub-directory with the challenge title, and then add a file named **`YourUsername.md`** inside it!

> _Replace "**YourUsername**" with your GitHub username!_

The **`YourUsername.md`** file should follow the Markdown format as provided below:
```
# Your Username - Challenge Title

## Challenge Flag: hacktoberfest_ctf{FLAG}

## Write-up:

_Place your write-up here!_
```

For example, for the "**Tactile**" challenge in Intermediate Cryptography, get inside the "Intermediate" directory of the "Crypto" directory, and then include your write-up in **`YourUsername.md`** file inside "Tactile" directory.
At the end, the directory structure would look like:
```
Writeups
│   README.md
│   SAMPLE.md
|
└───Crypto
    |
    └───Intermediate
        |
        └───Tactile
            |
            └───YourUsername.md
```
